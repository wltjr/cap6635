# CAP6635: Advanced Artificial Intelligence Assignment 3 <br> 3 x 3 World MDP Policy Generation using Value Iteration

## About
Assignment 3 is a command line 3 x 3 grid world modeled as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) to create a policy by using Value Iteration algorithm, using four
unique R values, -100, -3, 0, and 3, and producing a policy consisting of
←, →, ↑, and ↓ actions for each R value.
