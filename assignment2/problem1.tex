\begin{description}[itemsep=1em]
	\item[What does a population represent in this case?] \hfill \break
		All of the various puzzle states, every possible N-puzzle position, all puzzle state
		position permutations, including goal state; An array or string of unique numbers
		representing the value in each position \\
		E.g. for 8-puzzle goal 012345678.

	\item[What is your mutation function?] \hfill \break
		A function that changes the various values representing the tile positions in any puzzle
		state, choosing a random position to change, within the rules of the game. That would
		entail replacing the new value with the old at what ever position the old was located,
		as game rules would not allow for the same value in multiple locations, nor absence
		of others. \\
		E.g. for 8-puzzle 8765\underline{4}3210 $\rightarrow$ 4765\underline{8}3210

	\item[How does crossover happen in this case?] \hfill \break
		Cross over would need to take place based on the max/min amount of unique characters
		in each puzzle state, as the crossover could not duplicate the values for any puzzle
		state \\
		E.g. for 8-puzzle \underline{012}345678 x 876543\underline{210} $\rightarrow$ \underline{210}345678 | 876543\underline{012}

	\item[How do you evaluate the quality of a chromosome in this scenario?] \hfill
		You would need some scoring mechanism to score the resulting game state, aka
		chromosome, to determine which ones are of highest value, highest score, closest to
		or the goal state. One method of scoring combines the number of correct puzzle
		positions along with the Manhattan distance, with lower score being more desirable
		and goal/stop at 0.
